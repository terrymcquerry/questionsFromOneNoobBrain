# questionsFromOneNoobBrain

Thing is I really really belive I can learn by asking questions about things I care about and finding answers to them. Today, June 10th 2024, I'm intersted in stuff I know almost nothing about AND WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHINGGGG (kinda obsessively). I have very basic computer science knowledge (from a completely self thaught process, which I'm gonna keep at), and this is kinda of the start of the whole journey for me (I'm 24 btw)...
